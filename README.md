## Installation



* Download the latest version of Spiria CLI from the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/828500995435659265/834130201905987584">Discord server.</a>

* There may be a downloads bar on the bottom, press the up arrow and then select keep, since it is **completely safe and does not contain any harmful software.**

Once you double click Spiria CLI.exe, it will ask you for your key, which you can find <a href="https://dashboard.spiria.tools">here</a>.
You will not be able to use the same key on a different device after activating it on your current one.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Modules

More modules will be added over time.

### Amazon Coupon Code Applier

The Amazon Coupon Code Applier is designed to repeatedly purchase free items on Amazon using promotion codes and clipping coupons. The items may not ship, so you can receive Amazon credits instead if the products do not ship. 

<strong>Important: Please manually purchase the item first once so that you can delete incompatible addresses. The bot will only checkout if the cost is $0.00, so if something goes wrong, your cards will not be charged, but you may lose existing Amazon credits. However, you may be able to recover them from contacting Amazon support. The bot does not store or send ANY of your emails or passwords. Spiria is not responsible for any loss you may experience in running the bot. </strong>

1. Enter the Amazon product link you want to bot.
2. Enter your Amazon email. 
3. Enter your Amazon password. It will not be saved and does not get sent elsewhere.
4. Enter the Amazon promo code. Put a random one if there is none needed.
5. Enter the quantity of the product that you want to purchase.
6. **Please keep your mouse away from any hover menus. I would minimize the window or leave my computer to do something else because the process might take a while depending on the quantity of the products. Check the email associated with that Amazon account to ensure that it worked.**
